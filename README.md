# Hi there, I'm Moiz Ahmed (aka Sailor97) 👋

## About Me  
- 🔭 *10 years old* and currently in *class 5*.  
- 🌍 I live in *Lahore, Pakistan*.  
- 📅 Born on *14 August 2014*, I take pride in sharing my birthday with my country's Independence Day.  

## Interests  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness enthusiast, following *Sang Jin Wo's* workout routine, and proud of my unique *Kedroon Speed* (100 steps in 1 minute while running).  
- 🎬 A passionate fan of *Marvel*, *Monsterverse*, and the *MADDOG SuperNational Universe 2*.  
- 📺 Excited about new releases like What If...? Season 3 (aka Watcher Season 3), Solo Leveling Season 2, and movies like Vijay Nagar Vampire and the new Superman in DCU.  
- 📚 Avid reader and anime lover, with my favorite animes and mangas including:  
  - *Dragon Ball Z/Super/Daima*  
  - *Naruto & Boruto*  
  - *Solo Leveling*  
  - *Jujutsu Kaisen*  
  - *One Piece* (Shanks is my favorite character!)  
  - *Chainsaw Man* and more!  

## Beliefs and Theories  
- 🤔 I believe *Solo Leveling* deserves to be in the Big 3 of anime and predict that the future Big 3 will consist of *Solo Leveling, Boruto, and Demon Slayer*.  
- ⚡ Love imagining alternate universes and exciting fan theories, like potential villains in MADDOG or new episodes of Watcher.  

## Fun Facts
